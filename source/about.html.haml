  = link_to "a mildly successful software consultancy that does cool stuff (isotope11.com).", "http://isotope11.com"
  I'm an expert rubyist and have built systems that handle a billion plus worth
  of transactions per year (I sadly do not get a cut).  I've architected large
  projects for customers ranging from state agencies to federal agencies, and built tons of
  startups' apps.

  Having said that, I'm new to Erlang and newer to elixir
  (though I have built an actor model based financial trading platform in ruby
  with celluloid). The premise of the series is that I will learn elixir as a
  professional developer that is very experienced, and you will come along for
  the ride.

  I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that this entire format is inspired by

  If you like this, you're bound to love RubyTapas.
